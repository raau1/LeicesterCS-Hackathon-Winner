# 🏆 2024/25 - Let's Hack Leicester - Two-Day Student Pack Prototype Competition

## 🚀 My Project: Campus Essentials Locator

An **interactive map webpage/app** that highlights lesser-known and underrated spots on campus, such as:  
✅ Water dispensers  
✅ Bike racks  
✅ Quiet study areas  
✅ Microwaves  

A **digital “insider guide”** to campus that new or busy students would love!

## 🌟 Key Features

### 📍 **Point-of-Interest (POI) Mapping**
- List specific campus locations for each category, like:  
  - 🚲 **Bike Parking**  
  - 💧 **Water Refill Stations**  
  - 🍽 **Microwave Stations**  
  - 📖 **Quiet Study Spots**  

### 🔍 **Basic Filtering**
- Allow users to filter locations (e.g., show only water dispensers).  
- Implement a **button-toggling system** for easy UI interaction.

### 🗺 **Map Integration (Future Potential)**
- If time allows, integrate a **basic map view** with pins for each POI.
- **Too complex?** Stick to a simple **list or grid format** instead.

### 🏗 **User Contributions (Future Potential)**
- Let users **suggest new POI locations**, creating a **community-driven resource**.

## 🛠 Future Tech Stack Options

### 📌 **Backend Logic**
- Use **C#** or **Java** for handling data storage & retrieval.  
  ✅ **C# is recommended** since it’s familiar and easier for this task.

### 🎨 **Frontend/UI**
- **Web-based:** Use **JavaScript** with [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for interactive maps.  
- **Desktop/Mobile App:** Use **Unity** with **C#**.

### 📂 **Data Storage**
- **SQLite** (lightweight, manageable with Python/C#).  
- Or, for simplicity, use **JSON** as a file-based approach.
